**overview**
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews, classifying them as positive or negative. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, it preprocesses textual data, trains a classifier, and evaluates its performance. The goal is to develop a reliable sentiment classifier that can predict the sentiment of new movie reviews effectively.

**Features**
Text Preprocessing: Cleans and standardizes text by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, filtering stopwords, and applying lemmatization.

One-Hot Encoding: Converts text into numerical form for machine learning models.

Sequence Padding: Ensures consistent input sizes by padding sequences to a fixed length.

Machine Learning Model: Trains a Naive Bayes classifier and evaluates its accuracy on the IMDB dataset.

Single Review Prediction: Tests the model by classifying individual reviews as positive or negative.
